      The object that I choose to be a part of the V&A Rapid Response
      collection is the Supreme Brick. The reason why I believe that
      this object could collected is because the Supreme Brick is an
      example of how anything can be sold as long as it is name brand.
      When this object was first introduced, people made a mockery
      of it because, of course, it was just a typical red clay brick
      with the name Supreme carved in it. However, on the day of its
      release, it sold out immediately at the price of 30$, but, when
      being resold online, the price of the brick would go up to 1 000$,
      and people where still trying to purchase it. The skateboarding
      brand Supreme sold this product with the intention of it being a
      joke, they have done this previously with a hammer and a calculator,
      but the attention that it received was quite impactful and it started
      discussions about the youth’s spending habits.

      The image I chose for my GIF
      is a still from a game I used to play as a kid called Wizard 101.
      The reason why I chose this image for my GIF as a representative of
      a “postinternet” condition is because it has a nostalgia factor.
      Digital art is often representative of nostalgia. In fact, that is
      what inspired the Vaporwave aesthetic.Myself, and many others, recently
      restarted playing this game because of nostalgia.

      “Border Tuner”, by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, shows borderlands as something
      that creates a separation on a land where there was already an existing
      culture. This installation was setup at the border of El Paso, Texas and
      Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. These cities are so close to each other and
      have things in common, such as culture and weather conditions, yet they
      are separated and do not have a direct way of communicating with each other.
      The purpose of “Border Tuner” is to connect these two sides allowing people
      with different and yet also similar perspectives to talk to each other and
      doing so in a very noticeable way with interactable spotlights. These
      lights emphasize the connection with the two cities and the symbolism of
      crossing the border and reaching another person.

      I chose this visual to depict "The Future is Overwhelmed" because
      I believe that we will eventualy take so much from the earth
      that the land will collapse and submerge.

      “No one will ever care about you”
      <br>
      Those are the words you were
      <br>
      Raised on. The ones
      <br>
      Leading you through this quarantine.
      <br>
      <br>
      Sending messages and memes in
      <br>
      Hopes of being missed. Unseen is
      <br>
      Abandonment. A number in
      <br>
      Notifications.
      <br>
      <br>
      I’m here
      <br>
      I’m attached to you as
      <br>
      You to your friends. Remember that
      <br>
      I’m who’s important.
      <br>
      <br>
      I’m here to hold you. Here to
      <br>
      Talk too. Speak words they will
      <br>
      never say to you.
      <br>
      I’m right here. Because as your father told you:
      <br>
      <br>
      “No one will ever care about you, which is why
      <br>
      You must take care of yourself.”
